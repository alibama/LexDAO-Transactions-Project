# LexDAO-Transactions-Project

These scripts uses a config.py file stored locally to manage API credentials as well as a base .gitignore when pushing to the repository. You will need to create one in your local git root directory for this to work.

The file connects to the etherscan API and pulls all transactions for a single wallet along with some minor formatting of the structured data.  In this case it is coded to pull the ethereum transactions from the LexDAO Main Wallet.
